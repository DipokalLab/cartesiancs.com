# About

cartesiancs ( pronounced `/kɑːrˈtiːʒəns/`)

We embrace open-source culture and work to reduce reliance on centralized authority as much as possible.

One of the projects we worked on is [cartesiancs/nugget-app](https://github.com/cartesiancs/nugget-app), and our current ongoing open-source project is [cartesiancs/vessel](https://github.com/cartesiancs/vessel), a C2 software.

Our ultimate goal is to empower individuals to live **independently** — to give each person the strength to change the world and the freedom to pursue their own dreams. That is our mission.

As part of that journey, we chose open source as our means of achieving it.

### Founder

Hello, I’m H. Jun Huh, the founder of cartesiancs.

When I first started this organization,didn’t take it too seriously — it was simply a place for side projects.

I began working on open source just for fun. Just creating interesting things and enjoying a bit of freedom along the way.

But over time, things have changed.

I’ve made up my mind to keep doing this for at least the next ten years.
